# Prime for Tool Development

Load tool development patterns from Module 3 to prepare for building agent tools.

## Context

You are about to work on building or modifying agent tools that will be used by Pydantic AI agents. Load the comprehensive patterns and best practices we established in Module 3 for writing agent-optimized tool docstrings.

## Read

Read the tool docstring patterns: @.agents/docs/adding_tools_guide.md

## Process

Understand and internalize:

1. **Core Philosophy** - How agent tool docstrings differ from standard docstrings
2. **7 Required Elements** - One-line summary, "Use this when", "Do NOT use", Args with guidance, Returns, Performance Notes, Examples
3. **Agent Perspective** - Writing for LLM comprehension and tool selection
4. **Token Efficiency** - Documenting token costs and optimization strategies
5. **Anti-patterns** - Common mistakes that confuse agents
6. **Template Structure** - The exact format to follow

Pay special attention to:

- "Use this when" (affirmative guidance for tool selection)
- "Do NOT use" (negative guidance to prevent tool confusion)
- Performance Notes (token costs, execution time, limits)
- Realistic examples (not "foo", "bar", "test.md")
